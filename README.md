# ATtiny1617 Core Independent Nightlight Using Configurable CustomLogic

<a><img src="images/diagram.png" alt="diagram" width="800"/></a>

This example shows the use of Core Independent Peripherals (CIP), how to use theConfigurable Custom Logic (CCL) to filter inputs from different sensors, and how to create specificcommunication protocols using a Microchip AVRÂ® device, a Passive InfraRed sensor (PIR), Ambient LightSensor, and 16 addressable RGB LEDs. Many peripherals are configured to work together, independentof the CPU.

The example is explained in more details in the application note [AN2387](#Related-Documentation)

## Setup

![Circuit](images/circuit.png)

*   Color Button Connected to `PB0`
*   Intensity Button Connected to `PB1`
*   Ambient Light Sensor Connected to `PA7`
*   PIR Sensor Connected to `PB3`
*   RGB LED Connected to `PC1`

## Operation

1. Open `CoreIndependentNightLightusingCCL.X` in MPLAB.
2. Connect the ATtiny1617 with your programmer of choice, we used a Atmel ICE.
3. Make sure the kit is selected as the tool to be programmed under project settings.
4. Press the make and program button to program the device.
4. Press one of the buttons or interact with the sensors to wake the AVR and start the processing.

## Conclusion

We have shown how you can make a core independent nightlight using configurable customlogic. This is just one of the many usecases of configurable customlogic.
